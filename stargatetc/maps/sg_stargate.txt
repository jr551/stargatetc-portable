A fun map demonstrating the latest version of the stargate.
Features include new textures, resized DHD, improved 
chevrons, new sound effects, new opening and closing effects.
Now multiple players can enter the stargate at once and
arrive at their destination at the same, allowing a team to
outnumber enemies on the other side. Also you can now shoot
through the stargate. Beware campers!
Another new feature is new rings with new textures, several
people can use the rings at once.
The map itself is based on a egyptain temple.

Objectives:

Tau'ri: 
1) Use C4 to blow up the wall with the big painting in the
   room to the right as you enter the temple through the gate.
   Collect the keycard for the nuke and ring to the Goa'uld
   ship and detonate the nuke. Make sure you ring off the ship
   in time!

2)- Travel through the stargate and activate the two buttons 
    in the temple
  - Ring to the Goa'uld ship and activate the button there

Goa'uld:
  - Ring down to the planet and activate the two buttons in the
    temple
  - Travel through the stargate and activate the button on the

    round
