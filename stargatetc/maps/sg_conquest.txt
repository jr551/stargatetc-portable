Lethal toxic gas is leaking from the malfunctioning environmental system in 
the SGC. The stargate is the only means of escape as it would take too long to
reach the surface before the envoronmental controls come back online. The
planet dialed is that where SG-1 have just arrived for what was planned to be a 
routine recon mission. However, the Goa'uld have managed to steal a computer
card from the MALP before SG1s arrival which could allow them hack into the
SGCs computer. It must be retrieved at all costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing: 

Tau'ri:
Escape from the SGC through the gate, infiltrate the Goa'uld temple,
retrieve the computer card stolen by the goa'uld, return to the SGC with it and
place it back at the computer beside the star map.

Goa'uld:
Tau'ri have been detected near the Chapa'ai. Jaffa cree!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
-The iris can only be used in normal mode
-The environmental controls malfunction only happens in normal mode
-For the tau'ri that reaches the computer card there is a reward of 2 tacs and
a staff weapons hidden behind the blue tiled panel (activate it like a button).
i.e. You only die in Normal mode if you stay in the SGC
