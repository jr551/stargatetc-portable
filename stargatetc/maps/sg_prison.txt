------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your SG team traveled to a planet with an old and almost forgotten 
Goa'uld prison located on it. While you prepared a naquadah bomb at 
the ring transporters, a Goa'uld patrol overwhelmed you and put you 
in jail. 
Stupid like Jaffa are, they forgot to disarm you. But you have luck 
and a technical malfunction kills your guards and releases you of your 
cell. Take the chance and escape to the gate to get the bomb key and 
activate the naquadah bomb. Then get some distance between you and the 
bomb. Reach the stargate within 35 seconds and you should 
be in safe distance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Briefing:

Tau'ri: 
Return to the stargate to get the bomb key. Head back to the 
ring transporter to activate the bomb and then escape to the stargate 
again. You have 35 seconds till the bomb detonates.

Goa'uld: 
Prevent the Tau'ri from activating the bomb. Kill them!
