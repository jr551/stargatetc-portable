The FN P90 submachine gun (SMG) was developed in the late
1980s as a defensive weapon for the troops whose primary
activities does not include small arms - vehicle and tank
crew members, artillery crews etc. Standart pistols and
SMGs chambered for pistol rounds were proved ineffective
against enemy soldiers, wearing armour (bulletproof) vests,
so FN Herstal developed a new round with enhanced
penetration - the SS190. This round looks like scaled
downt 5.56mm NATO round and forces the pointed, steel
core bullet to the 600-700 meters per second at the muzzle,
thus being capable to defeat standart CRISAT helmets and
armour vests at reasonable distances (50-100 meters).
