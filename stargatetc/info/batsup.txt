Torture Stick
==========================================================

Overall Length: 450mm
Head Length: 33mm
Action: Flesh Ionisation, Neural stimulation

The Goa’uld torture stick uses a positive ion generator to
stimulate every pain receptor neuron in the human body.
The ions are released from the head when pressed against a
surface delivering the ions at an almost fatal level. The
torture stick can kill if applied for too great a time
because it ionises the flesh making all tissues break
their atomic bonds. On higher settings, the ions travel
down the neural connections like wires and release
themselves into any oxygen environment available when over
saturated. Evidence of this can be seen as bright light
coming from the eyes and mouth.
