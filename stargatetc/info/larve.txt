Goa'uld Larval Symbiot
==========================================================

Type: Goa'uld Symbiot not ready for implantation
Action: Biological Sabotage

The Larval Symbiot is a parasitic life form, which forces
control of a host when mature. The Larval form however
will be able to do so and will cause a subject to take
damage internally until the larva dies. The Goa’uld have
taken this to their advantage by supplying their troops
with tubes full of larva.
