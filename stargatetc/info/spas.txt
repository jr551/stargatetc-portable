The SPAS-12 was designed in the late 1970s by the Italian
company Luigi Franchi Spa as a special purpose, military
and police close combat weapon (actually, SPAS stands for
Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, or Special Purpose
Automatic Shotgun, depending on the source). It featured
a selective action for greater versatility, and can be
used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a
manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the
mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction
SPAS-12 became a very popular police and special forces
weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower.
On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar
shotguns and quite complicated, which results in
relatively high prices.
