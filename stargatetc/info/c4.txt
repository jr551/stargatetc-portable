C4 Pack
==========================================================

Type: Remote Pack Charge
Action: Electrical Detonator via radio signal

The plasticized form of RDX, composition C-4, contains 91%
RDX, 2.1% polyisobutylene, 1.6% motor oil, and 5.3%
2-ethylhexyl sebacate. The Demolition charge M183 is used
primarily in breaching obstacles or demolition of large
structures where large charges are required
(Satchel Charge). The charge assembly M183 consists of 16
block demolition charges M112, four priming assemblies and
carrying case M85. Each Priming assembly consists of a
five-foot length of detonating cord assembled with two
detonating cord clips and capped at each end with a
booster. The components of the assembly are issued in the
carrying case. The demolition charge M112 is a rectangular
block of Composition C-4 approximately 2 inches by 1.5
inches and 11 inches long, weighing 1.25 Lbs. When the
charge is detonated, the explosive is converted into
compressed gas. The gas exerts pressure in the form of a
shock wave, which demolishes the target by cutting,
breaching, or cratering.
