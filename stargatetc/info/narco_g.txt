Narcotic Gas Grenade 
==========================================================

Type: Psychotropic drug gas
Action: Chemical release, Chemical Mixture

Narcotic gas grenades are an effective way to render enemy
troops skills disabled by confusing and disorientating
them. It is made of a synthetic mind-altering drug witch
is absorbed though the skin and by breathing. Snipers are
the most effected by this weapon as it makes aiming almost
impossible to even the best-trained soldier. The effects
of this drug can last up to three minutes, which was the
attractive feature for the air force as any captured troop
would be able to be interrogated without a dry out period.
