Goa'uld Hand Device (Ribbon Device)
==========================================================

Weight: 2.3kg
Action: Atomic Disassembly, Atomic Displacement

With concentration and practise the hand device can be a
devastating weapon. Primarily it delivers lepton stream
into a narrow area creating an atomic interference field,
which also has the side effect of creating great heat. Its
Secondary use is a lepton pulse, which forces any matter
in its patch to be carried away with its wave. People can
only use this weapon with Naquada in his/her blood. The
weapon scans the neural activity in the users fingertips
and fires on detection of specific messages, that the user
must be trained to produce.
