USAS-12 shotgun was developed in South Korea by Daewoo
Precision Industries somewhere in the 1980s, and according
to some sources, its design is based on experimental
Atchisson Assault Shotgun, developed in 1970s in USA by
someone Maxwell Atchisson. USAS-12 was intended as a
special purpose,  military or special operations close
combat weapon with extreme firepower. It was exported from
South Korea in many countries, including the USA, but in
1994 under the new US law it was classified as a Class III
"Destructive device", which limited its civilian sales and
use. It is still offered for military and law enforcement
agencies, though.
