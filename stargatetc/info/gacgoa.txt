Gac'Goa
==========================================================

Type: Goa'uld Shock Grenade
Action: Ultra Bright Light Flare

The Gac’Goa fires a large spread of laser quantity light
which sends anyone in the immediate area without
protection to be temporarily blind. Uses for this device
include covering before charging and an escape-aiding
tool. This device has enough power for a single flare
after which it is permanently damaged.
