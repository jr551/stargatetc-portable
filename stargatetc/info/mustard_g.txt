Mustard Gas Grenade 
==========================================================

Type: Flesh dissolving gas
Action: Chemical release

This United Nations banned chemical agent similar to 
napalm was approved for off world use only because it is
the only effective means to kill water borne Goa’uld. It
is also used in combat for weakening an enemy before
actual fighting begins. It is also capable of revealing
invisible goa’uld by blocking the emitters of the cloaking
device with oxidised compounds from it’s own coating.
Prolonged expose to this gas will result in a painful
death.
