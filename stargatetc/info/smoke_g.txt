Smoke Grenade 
==========================================================

Type: Visual Impairing device
Action: Chemical reaction, Chemical release

Smoke grenades are a cheap and simple to use visual
protection tool. These use the standard G62 chemical
release canisters with a pin release pressure lock. The
Best way to use this tool is to cover an advance down long
narrow paths where snipers could be a problem. It is also
recommended for street crossing and placing in likely
sniper vantage points.
