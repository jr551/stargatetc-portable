The PSG-1 sniper system (PrazisionsSchutzenGewehr, or 
"high-precision marksman's rifle" in English) had been 
developed by the German company Heckler - Koch by the 
mid-1980s as an ultimate police and counter-terror weapon.
Some German elite law-enforcement groups, like GSG or 
KSK-9, participate in this development, and since its 
introduction the PSG-1 had been adopted by various police 
forces in Europe and Americas. It is way too heavy and 
somewhat too gentle for military use, so it never seen any
military use. Instead, HK developed two more sniper 
weapons. The first, that actually preceded the PSG-1, was
the G3-SG1, an accurized and scope-fitted version of the
basic G3 automatic rifle for German Army. And in the
mid-1980s HK also developed a derivative of the PSG-1,
called MSG-90, for export military sales. The PSG-1 is
still offered by the HK, and is one of the most expensive
factory-made sniper rifles on the market, hitting the
$10.000 price tag in the basic package.
