Cloaking Device
==========================================================

Type: Advanced Camouflage
Weight: 0.82 kg
Action: Phase shifting bubble

Personal cloaking devise for the system lords and various
assassins, the Cloaking device is one of the biggest
advantages on the battlefield. Its only rival is the 
T.E.R, which will easily spot a user unless well
positioned. Though it stops light it is only a small phase
shift and will still allow the emission of heat and sound
from the wearer. This means any direct contact with the
enemy or loud footsteps may give away your position.
Unfortunately the cloak will phase back to normal for a
short time when passing matter or energy in and out of the
bubble at high speed or mass quantity. Any firing of
weapons or throwing of objects will instantly have this
effect. The advantages of this device only stay effective
if used with correct tactics.
