The Tak/Tac is a personal defensive weapon, designed for
Use against superior numbers. The Tak is a versatile tool
with three modes can be extremely effective in many
environments. It’s first mode (Basic Mode) it can fire
highly focused laser beams similar to the zatarc weapon
but with much more limited range. The second mode
(Stun Mode) is a nerve-dampening beam designed to stun and
weaken the enemy for an easy ambush. It’s third and most
advanced setting is the Assassin mode, which fires a less
powerful version of the basic mode but with the remaining
power used to cloak itself. This mode is most effective in
open areas where normally taks would be easily seen and
removed. The mode is shown by the eye color. Red for
basic, Yellow for stun and Green for assassin. It is
recommended that more than one Tak be placed in the same
area to affect as much damage as possible. The Tak also
uses advanced AI and networked communication to attack
in the most efficient method.
