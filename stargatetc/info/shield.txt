Personal Shielding Device
==========================================================

Type: Goa'uld Protective Device
Action: Particle Barrier

The Personal Shield blocks all forms of energy or matter
passing into its field at high speed. There are two main
disadvantages with this device. Firstly When activated you
cannot move without passing through the barrier and
interrupting the flow direction. The emitter will be able
to keep the barrier in the same position as long as the
user stays inside. Secondly it does not stop slower moving
objects so to allow fresh air to enter the barrier.
Because of this weakness it has no defence against unarmed
combat or thrown objects.
