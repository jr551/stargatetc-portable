The Heckler und Koch submachine gun, MP-5, is one of the
most famous and wide-spread firearms of its class,
developed since the Second World War. Its development
began circa 1964 under the company designation HK MP-54,
or simply HK 54. In the 1966, German police and Border
Guard adopted the HK 54 as the MP-5, and it was originally
available in two forms - MP-5 with fixed buttstock and
MP-5A1 with retractable buttstock. Some years later HK
slightly upgraded the design of MP-5, replacing the sights
(from flip-up open notch rear and blade front to drum-type
diopter rear and hooded post front) and the muzzle
(replacing the two-slot muzzle compensator to the
tree-lugs QD silencer mount without compensator). Other
improvements made over the time concerned the magazines
(early type magazines were of straight box type, latter
of curved box type for improved reliability). The trigger
units also were upgraded - from original stamped steel
with plastic grip to the all-plastic units, integral with
grip, and with various fire modes and marking. Over the
years MP-5 were adopted by the huge numbers of police,
security and military forces around the world, including
the German police and border guard, British police and
elite Army SAS units, American police, FBI, Navy and
Marine Corps, and many, many others. MP-5 is still
manufactured in Germany by the HK itself, and also
licensed to Greece, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico.
