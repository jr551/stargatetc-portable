T.E.R. (Transphase Eradication Rod)
==========================================================

A Weapon capable of revealing invisible matter that is
phased out of the normal human sensory perception. This
weapon uses a focused resonation field to force any matter
not normally visible to reflect and refract light like any
other object. It's primary function is a hyperphased
energy pulse capable of damaging anything visible or not.
it's effects are similar to the staff weapon but is more
spread out over a larger area. Not all invisible matter
requires a hyperphased pulse to effect it, which allows
anyone with conventional weapons to target also in some
cases.
