Glider Staff
==========================================================

The Glider Staff is a larger form of the widely used staff
weapon. The clever design allows for the easy removal of
the unit for troop use but requires training to operate
without causing self harm. The staff builds up plasma
energy by passing pure hydrogen back and forth at a rapid
speed over a series of superheated naquada shaft. When the
firing trigger is forces, the plasma is then ejected out
of it’s electromagnetic containment pod which is found on
the firing end of the staff. With the amount of plasma
ejected in the glider version of the staff it can produce 
a recoil rating of up to 78. Dammage is extreme and all
firing should be a aimed at least 20-30 meters from the
user.
