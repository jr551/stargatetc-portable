The M16 is still a general-issue rifle with the US Armed
forces. It is also widely used by the US Law Enforcement
agencies, either in military form (for example, the LAPD
had some M16s, retired from Army), or in "civilian"
semi-automatic only form. The AR-15 style rifles are made
in the USA by at least dozen large companies, such as
Armalite, Bushmaster, Colt, FN Manufacturing, Hesse, Les
Baer, Olympic, Wilson Combat, and by number of smaller
companies, many of which do assembly their rifles from
components made by some other major manufacturers.
M16-type rifles also manufactured outside of the USA,
most notably in the Canada, by Diemaco Co. China also
makes some AR-15 type rifles at NORINCO state factories.
M16 rifles are used by many foreign military groups, most
notably the British SAS, who preferred the M16 over the
infamous L85A1 rifle, and by many others.
