Healing Device
==========================================================

Type: Bio Regenerator
Action: Cell & Structure replication

It is the field version of the Goa’uld healing device
usable by Jaffa. Created by the goa’uld after releasing
they needed medical aid to maintain their ranks, the
healing device is the most powerful healing tool on the
battlefield. The regeneration technology is similar to
that of the sarcophagus but with much less power. The
device can heal most fatal wounds short of poisoning and
complete annihilation.
